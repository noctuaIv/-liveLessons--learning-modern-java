/** An applet that loads an image from an absolute
 *  URL. This URL MUST be on the same machine
 *  that the applet came from. So, this approach is NOT
 *  useful for applets. But in desktop applications, this
 *  approach is very useful. Plus, this gives me an excuse
 *  to introduce try/catch blocks. But, please note that
 *  you will get an error message if you try to run this applet,
 *  since it is not deployed on corewebprogramming.com.
